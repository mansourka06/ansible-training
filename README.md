# ansible-training
Practical Ansible training as part of a DevOps training program.


## What is Ansible?

* Ansible is an open source DevOps tool that can help companies with configuration management, deployment, provisioning and more. It's easy to deploy; it uses SSH to communicate between servers. It uses the playbook to describe automation tasks, and the playbook uses a very simple language, YAML.


* In recent years, the Ansible tool (by RedHat) has been gaining ground on the market and has established itself as the benchmark tool for Configuration Management.

* These practical exercises will enable you to master the fundamentals of automating (industrializing) deployment and configuration processes.
